## 2. Project overview 🌾📊

### 2.1 Project idea (short description)
In few sentences, describe: <br/>
- the agricultural context (what system/crop/problem?) <br/>
- the data science task (what will you do with the data?) <br/>

### 2.2 Motivation / why it matters 🌎

In just a few bullets, explain why this project is interesting or useful (scientifically, agronomically, or practically). <br/>

## 3. Objectives & research questions ❓

Write **main objectives** (2-3 max.). Keep them specific and realistic for the semester.

### 3.1 Objectives
1.  
2.  


### 3.2 Research questions or hypotheses (optional)
If appropriate, list 1–3 questions/hypotheses.

## 4. Data plan 🗃️

Students may use data from their own research, but they **must comply with the Data Usage Policy for the Semester Project**.

### 4.1 Data source(s)
Describe the dataset you will use: <br/>
- **Dataset name / description:** All_practice_data / CSV File 
- **Where it comes from (source):** M.Sc practice data  
- **Owner (if applicable):** OCP/Adrian Correndo  
- **Access method (public link, instructor-provided, member-provided):** Member-provided   
- **File format(s):** CSV and XLSX (CSV, XLSX, etc.)  

### 4.2 Data usage policy compliance 🔒
Briefly confirm how you comply with the course policy (check all that apply and add notes).

- [ ] Data are public/openly available OR permission has been obtained.
- [ ] Data do not contain private/personal/confidential information.
- If using research/industry data: 
- [ ] identifiers will be removed or data aggregated if needed.
- [ ] All data sources will be cited/acknowledged appropriately.
- [ ] The group can share the dataset with the instructor/TA for grading (or a permitted alternative is described below).

**Notes (if any):**

### 4.3 Expected data structure 🧱
Describe how the “final tidy table” will look like.

- **Unit of observation (one row = ?):** 10 treatments at 2 sites
- **Key columns (examples):** (e.g., site, year, treatment, cultivar, N_rate, yield, protein, etc.)  
- **Approximate size:** (81 rows, 30 columns)  
- **Missing data expected?** No, all expected data should be present 

### 4.4 Data cleaning needs 🧹
Examples of common issues (check all that apply and add notes): <br/>
- missing values  
- inconsistent units  
- messy Excel sheets / merged cells  
- multiple files to combine  
- variable naming inconsistencies  

Your issues:

## 5. Methods & reproducible workflow 🔁

### 5.1 Planned analysis (high level)
In bullets, list the core steps you expect to do.

Examples:
- exploratory data analysis (tables/plots)  <br/>
- summarize treatments across sites/years  <br/>
- simple models (e.g., regression, mixed models) if appropriate  <br/>
- compare scenarios (e.g., management practices)  <br/>

Your plan:
-  clean data set in Excel
-  clean data set in R
-  create new columns, rows and stand alone data sets
-  explore data in R with tables and plots
-  find relationships and correlations through models
-  create tables and visual components to display the findings 

### 5.2 Reproducibility plan (required) ✅
Describe what you will do to ensure the project is reproducible.

Examples:
- **Project organization:** folders (data/raw, data/clean, R/, output/, etc.) <br/>
- **Version control:** Git + GitHub (required) <br/>
- **Documentation:** comments in code, README file/s <br/>
- **Quarto output:** (report, slides) <br/>

Your plan:
-  shared teams project/folders 
-  Git and Github 
-  make several revisions and copies with date attached 
-  lots of comments within the code
-  headers to outline
-  keep all code in chunks 

### 5.3 Tools (R packages / software) 🧰
List the main tools you expect to use.

-  dplyr (filter, slice, group_by, mutate, rename, summarize)
-  ggplot (geom, aes, etc...)
-  tidyr (fill, pivot_longer/wider, list)
-  Quarto documents  

---

## 6. Deliverables 📦

List what you intend to submit at the end (even if this changes later).

Minimum expected deliverables typically include:
- a reproducible Quarto report (HTML/PDF)
- clean data (or scripted cleaning)
- well-documented code

Your planned deliverables:  
- a reproducible Quarto report (HTML/PDF)
- clean data (or scripted cleaning)
- well-documented code
- finding/results in plots and tables 

---

## 7. Timeline (high level) 🗓️

Provide a simple timeline across the semester (milestones).

- **Week 5:** proposal finalized + data secured  
- **Week 6:** data cleaning complete  
- **Week 7:** EDA and first results  
- **Week 11:** finalize analysis + draft report  
- **Week 13:** final edits + submission
