## 2. Project overview 🌾📊

### 2.1 Project idea (short description)
In few sentences, describe: <br/>

  The agricultural context (what system/crop/problem?) <br/>
- The purpose of this data analysis project is to examine phosphorous (P) rates and sources in RCBD plots across two locations.  
- Soil data were collected at the plot level and can be linked to fertilizer rates to determine the amount of P in each plot.  
- The goal is to re-evaluate current P rates for corn and soybean in southern Ontario.  

  The data science task (what will you do with the data?) <br/>
- Explore the data to determine if there is any correlation or relationship between P levels and relative yield values.   
- Investigate the variables to uncover any other correlations or relationships within the data.  

### 2.2 Motivation / why it matters 🌎

In just a few bullets, explain why this project is interesting or useful (scientifically, agronomically, or practically). <br/>

-  Agronomically, Ontario P rate reccommendations need to be updated.
-  Interestingly, this project uses soil samples at the plot level rather than the block level to uncover soil nutrient spatial variability. 

---

## 3. Objectives & research questions ❓

Write **main objectives** (2-3 max.). Keep them specific and realistic for the semester.

### 3.1 Objectives
1. Find the correlation between phosphorous levels and relative yield.
2. Uncover the insufficient rate of phosphorus fertilizer, which might be determined by comparing check plots with treatment plots using regression models.   


### 3.2 Research questions or hypotheses (optional)
If appropriate, list 1–3 questions/hypotheses.

-  To determine the sufficient source, either triple superphosphate (TSP) or monoammonium phosphate (MAP), and the rate of P required to achieve 95% relative yield in corn and soybean in southern Ontario.

## 4. Data plan 🗃️

Students may use data from their own research, but they **must comply with the Data Usage Policy for the Semester Project**.

### 4.1 Data source(s)
Describe the dataset you will use: <br/>
- **Dataset name / description:** All_practice_data / CSV File   
- **Where it comes from (source):** M.Sc practice data    
- **Owner (if applicable):** OCP/Adrian Correndo    
- **Access method (public link, instructor-provided, member-provided):** Member-provided     
- **File format(s):** CSV and XLSX (CSV, XLSX, etc.)    

### 4.2 Data usage policy compliance 🔒
Briefly confirm how you comply with the course policy (check all that apply and add notes).

- [x] Data are public/openly available OR permission has been obtained.
- [x] Data do not contain private/personal/confidential information.
- [x] If using research/industry data: 
- [x] Identifiers will be removed or data aggregated if needed.
- [x] All data sources will be cited/acknowledged appropriately.
- [x] The group can share the dataset with the instructor/TA for grading (or a permitted alternative is described below).

**Notes (if any):**

### 4.3 Expected data structure 🧱
Describe how the “final tidy table” will look like.

- **Unit of observation (one row = ?):** 10 treatments at 2 sites
- **Key columns (examples):** (e.g., site, year, treatment, cultivar, N_rate, yield, protein, etc.)  
- **Approximate size:** (81 rows, 30 columns)  
- **Missing data expected?** No, all expected data should be present 

### 4.4 Data cleaning needs 🧹
Our issues (check all that apply and add notes): <br/>
- Missing values (e.g., N/A, 0)   
- Inconsistent units (metric vs. imperial)     
- Messy Excel sheets (e.g., merged cells, upper vs. lowercase)  
- Multiple files or sheets to combine    
- Variable naming inconsistencies

## 5. Methods & reproducible workflow 🔁

### 5.1 Planned analysis (high level)
In bullets, list the core steps you expect to do.

Our plan:  
-  Clean the dataset in Excel  
-  Clean the dataset in R  
-  Create new columns, rows, and standalone datasets  
-  Explore the data in R using tables and plots  
-  Identify relationships and correlations through models  
-  Create tables and visual components to display the findings     

### 5.2 Reproducibility plan (required) ✅
Describe what you will do to ensure the project is reproducible.

Our plan:  
-  Use shared project/folders in Microsoft Teams   
-  Version control using Git and GitHub   
-  Maintain regular, dated revisions of all files   
-  Include extensive comments within the code  
-  Use clear headers to outline sections of the analysis  
-  Keep all code contained within Quarto code chunks   

### 5.3 Tools (R packages / software) 🧰
List the main tools you expect to use.

-  dplyr (filter, slice, group_by, mutate, rename, summarize) 
-  ggplot2 (geom, aes, etc.)  
-  tidyr (fill, pivot_longer/wider, list)  
-  Quarto documents

## 6. Deliverables 📦

List what you intend to submit at the end (even if this changes later).


Your planned deliverables:  
- a reproducible Quarto report (HTML/PDF)  
- clean data (or scripted cleaning)  
- well-documented code  
- finding/results in plots and tables   

---

## 7. Timeline (high level) 🗓️

Provide a simple timeline across the semester (milestones).

- **Week 5:** Proposal finalized + data secured  
- **Week 6:** Data cleaning complete  
- **Week 7:** EDA and first results
